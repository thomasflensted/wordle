## Wordle Replica

I made this replica of Wordle to practice my React skills. <br/>
[Try it out here.](https://wordle-aagw.onrender.com/) <br/>
Note that because it's running on render.com's free tier, the server spins down after 15 minutes of activity, so the first fetch request will be very slow. After the first fetch request it will work as intended.

I used [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the animations.

### Todo
* Disable all key and click events while animations take place.
